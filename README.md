# Java-EmailClient 

Java-EmailClient is a custom email Client coded completely in Java and some CSS for styling. 

Using your gmail account, you can login and view current emails in inbox, Spam, sent, etc. 

This program also gives you the ability to download attachments, compose messages, and send emails to others directly from the UI. 

When you view a message in Java-EmailClient, it will view it in your inbox. You can also mark emails as Unread.
